# Chowhowse.com

This is the data for [chowhowse.com](http://www.chowhowse.com), the personal website of Erik Letson. It is included on GitHub in an effort to be as
open as possible with the source code (in particular the PHP and JavaScript), as well as to facilitate updating the site itself. It is not really
intended to be a collaborative project, though I suppose I would accept improvements if someone truly took the time to make them. Hopefully someone
will find this repo useful in some way!
