                    <h2>About Me</h2>

                    <br/>

                    <p>
                        My name is Erik Letson. I am a programmer by trade, and I am currently employed at 
                        <a href="http://www.procryptix.com">Procryptix</a>,
                         which is a software development firm that I am also part owner of. Procryptix is primarily focused on applications of
                        blockchain technology in the business sector. My duties at Procryptix include client- and server-side web development,
                        API programming, UI design and implementation, and application development. Before Procryptix, I also worked for a time as
                        an independent video game designer.
                    </p>

                    <br/>

                    <p>
                        I was born in Lawrence County, Alabama in 1993, and grew up in Alabama and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. I began programming
                        at age fifteen, starting out with simple web-page design and soon moving on to more fully-featured programming with 
                        object-oriented languages like Python, C++, and Java. I attended Calhoun Community College in Decatur, Alabama, and graduated
                        in 2016. Over the course of 2015 and 2016 I participated in the One Game A Month challenge, during which I created 12
                        video games of various types. You can find the games I created on 
                        <a href="https://www.onegameamonth.com/HellaMagellan">my One Game A Month profile</a>.
                    </p>

                    <br/>

                    <p>
                        I am a strong believer in the importance of free (as in "free speech") software. I am also an advocate for a free culture,
                        that is, a system wherein cultural works are not automatically subject to restrictive "intellectual property" laws, and where
                        ideas can be freely shared, modified, sold, and enjoyed by everyone without fear of governmental retribution. I write 
                        frequently on this and related topics.
                    </p>
                        
                    <br/>

                    <h2>About This Website</h2>

                    <br/>

                    <p>
                        I started this website in August of 2017 to be a repository of most of my written works. I didn't exactly want a blog, and
                        I was interested in the ins and outs of managing a website as an individual, so I started this site using a domain name I
                        have owned since 2014. I originally intended "Chowhowse" to be a sort of video game portal (similar to Newgrounds), but the
                        economic viability of those types of websites is suspect at this point. 
                    </p>

                    <br/>

                    <p>
                        This website is hosted on a cloud server that I rent from 
                        <a href="https://www.atlantic.net/">Atlantic.Net</a>.
                        I store a copy of this website in a GitHub repo 
                        <a href="https://www.github.com/ErikLetson/chowhowse-site">here</a>.
                        I use GitHub for added convenience since it allows me to develop the Chowhowse website on my local machine, push the repo,
                        and retrieve it on the server when I'm ready. Plus, I feel that having the site available from a public repository makes
                        the whole thing more transparent. I create the webpages on the site by hand using Vim.
                    </p>
                        
                    <br/>

                    <p>
                        I also use this website to practice my Esperanto by translating the pages I write. I do the same with Spanish and Japanese,
                        though since I am not actively studying those languages I often supplement my own work with machine translations. If you
                        spot any errors in my alternate language articles (or, indeed, in my English ones), please let me know by contacting me
                        at admin (at) chowhowse (dot) com.
